# School Project - Exploratory Data Analysis in Tableau: Investigating Gender Discrimination in Salaries at Houston College of Medicine

This analysis stems from a case filed a few years ago in the United States District Court of Houston under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The plaintiffs, a group of female doctors at Houston College of Medicine, alleged that the institution had systematically discriminated against women in promotions and salary decisions. The lead plaintiff, a pediatrician and assistant professor, claimed she was unfairly denied a promotion. The data presented by the plaintiffs suggested that female faculty members were less likely to be promoted to full professors, more likely to remain assistant professors, and earned lower salaries compared to their male counterparts.

Data for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle.
